Prep for Geo for Good Summit, mostly a quick run through of online tutorials

* [9th Geo for Good Summit](https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/events/geoforgood20)
* [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)
* You'll need to register a API key (and probably enter billing information, hopefully will get free trial to test it out first)
* Then restrict the API either by website or API(?), the dashboard walks through the steps
